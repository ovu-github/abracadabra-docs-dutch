## Introduction

__[Abracadabra.money](https://docs.abracadabra.money/)__ is a lending platform that uses interest-bearing tokens (ibTKNs) as collateral to borrow a USD pegged stablecoin (Magic Internet Money - MIM), that can be used as any other traditional stablecoin.

Currently, a lot of assets, such as yVaults have locked in capital that can't be put to further use. Abracadabra offers an opportunity to use it.
